# Review Tracker Documentation

## Overview
Review Tracker is a command-line tool for managing code review progress across C# files in a project.
It uses SQLite to track which files have been reviewed and when, helping you systematically work
through a codebase.

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher (no additional packages required - uses only standard library)

### Setup
1. Download the `review_tracker.py` script to your tools directory
2. Make it executable (Linux/Mac): `chmod +x review_tracker.py`
3. That's it! The database will be created automatically on first use.

## Usage

### Basic Commands

#### Scan Directory
Recursively finds all `.cs` files in a directory and adds them to the tracking database.
Files are stored with relative paths from the scan directory for better portability.
```bash
python review_tracker.py -scan /path/to/project
```

Example for TazUO:
```bash
python review_tracker.py -scan ../src
```

#### Update Review Status
Mark a specific file as reviewed (records current timestamp).
Accepts both relative and absolute paths.
```bash
python review_tracker.py -update /path/to/file.cs
```

Example:
```bash
python review_tracker.py -update ClassicUO.Client/Game/GameController.cs
```

#### Get Next File
Get the next file that needs review. Selection is randomized within priority tiers
(prioritizes never-reviewed files, then oldest reviews):
```bash
python review_tracker.py -next
```

#### View Statistics
Display review progress statistics:
```bash
python review_tracker.py -stats
```

### Advanced Options

#### Custom Database Location
By default, the database is stored as `review_tracker.db` in the current directory.
You can specify a different location:
```bash
python review_tracker.py -db /path/to/custom.db -scan ../src
```

## Workflow Example

1. **Initial Setup**: Scan your project
   ```bash
   cd tools
   python review_tracker.py -scan ../src
   ```

2. **Start Reviewing**: Get the next file (random selection)
   ```bash
   python review_tracker.py -next
   ```

3. **After Review**: Mark the file as reviewed
   ```bash
   python review_tracker.py -update /path/shown/by/next
   ```

4. **Check Progress**: View statistics
   ```bash
   python review_tracker.py -stats
   ```

5. **Repeat**: Continue with steps 2-4

## Database Schema

The tool uses a simple SQLite database with one table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE reviews (
    path TEXT PRIMARY KEY,           -- Relative path to the file
    last_reviewed DATETIME           -- ISO format timestamp or NULL
);
```

## Features

- **Automatic Filtering**: Skips common non-source directories (.git, .vs, bin, obj, packages)
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Won't add the same file twice
- **Random Selection**: Files are selected randomly within priority tiers to avoid bias
- **Priority System**: Files never reviewed are prioritized over old reviews
- **Relative Paths**: Files are stored with relative paths for better portability
- **Simple Storage**: Uses SQLite - no external database required
- **Portable**: Pure Python with no dependencies outside standard library

## Tips

- Run the scan command periodically to pick up new files
- Use `-stats` to track your progress
- The database is portable - you can share it with team members
- Files are stored with relative paths, making the database more portable across systems
- Random selection helps distribute reviews more evenly across the codebase
